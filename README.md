# 🌊🤖 Dynamo Protocol

**Streaming Money. Tokenized Agents. AI + DeFi in Real Time.**

Dynamo Protocol is a **Layer 3 blockchain on Arbitrum Orbit**, purpose-built for **streaming token payments, AI-native economic agents, and verifiable DeFi intelligence**.  

Just as Ethereum turned *code into money*, Dynamo turns **intelligence into capital coordination**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **⏱ Streaming Token Payments**  
  Real-time, per-second token streams for salaries, subscriptions, rewards, and API usage.  
  Wallets show *“ticking balances”* that update continuously.

- **🤖 Token-Gated AI Agents**  
  Agents consume $DYNAMO to operate and earn $DYNAMO in continuous streams.  
  Every interaction is *metered* and *verifiable*.

- **🃏 DeFi Strategy Cards**  
  Shareable, meme-friendly AI outputs that summarize live opportunities:  
  - Vault / Pool  
  - Yield (APY)  
  - Risk Level  
  - Entry/Exit Rules  
  - Agent “Quote”  

  Forward-looking, grounded in **real-time DeFi data** — perfect for Crypto Twitter.

- **⚡ Consensus-Level Streaming**  
  Built as an Arbitrum Orbit L3 with **sub-second block times** and **deterministic ordering**.  
  Eliminates MEV at the root level.

- **📊 Grounded in Live DeFi Data**  
  TVL, APY, open interest, funding rates, liquidation clusters, and liquidity flows.  
  No hallucinations. No guesswork. **Verifiable intelligence only.**

- **🔗 Advanced DEX Integration**  
  Native integration with AMMs and orderbooks (Uniswap v3, GMX, Injective, etc.).  
  Agents route liquidity *continuously*, minimizing slippage and maximizing yield.

## 🧩 Architecture

1. **Consensus Layer** — Arbitrum Orbit L3 with sub-second finality.  
2. **Streaming Engine** — Balances modeled as continuous functions of time.  
3. **Agent Execution** — Token-gated FSMs (finite state machines), metered by $DYNAMO.  
4. **Data Integration** — Oracle-secured feeds (Chainlink, Pyth) grounding agent outputs.

## 🪙 Token Utility: $DYNAMO

- **Fuel for Streams** — all payments, subscriptions, and transfers.  
- **Agent Gating** — stake & stream to deploy and run AI agents.  
- **Governance** — DAO voting with quadratic weighting.  
- **Burn Mechanism** — fee sinks that reduce circulating supply.  
- **Reflexive Loop** — adoption → usage → burns → scarcity → value → adoption.

---

## 📌 Use Cases

- **Streaming Salaries** — DAOs, startups, and contributors get paid per second.  
- **Subscriptions** — pay-as-you-go for AI services, cloud compute, or DeFi tooling.  
- **Agent Marketplaces** — deploy AI copilots that earn continuous revenue streams.  
- **Yield Automation** — real-time portfolio rebalancing across DeFi protocols.  
- **Treasury Ops** — DAOs manage assets proactively with agent monitoring.  
- **Cultural Flex** — share verifiable Strategy Cards instead of unverifiable screenshots.  
- **Agent-to-Agent Economies** — autonomous liquidity negotiation and coordination.

---

## 📊 Roadmap

- **Phase 1** — Launch Arbitrum Orbit L3, streaming primitives, Strategy Cards MVP.  
- **Phase 2** — Expand DEX integrations (Uniswap v3, GMX, Injective), agent SDK.  
- **Phase 3** — Cross-chain streaming, ZK-proofed agent reasoning, agent-to-agent liquidity networks.  
- **Phase 4** — Full AI–DeFi ecosystem with autonomous coordination across human and machine actors.

## 📚 Research Basis

- Continuous token streaming at consensus (beyond Superfluid/Sablier).  
- MEV mitigation through deterministic ordering \[Daian et al., Flash Boys 2.0\].  
- AI agents as token-gated finite state machines.  
- Reflexive tokenomics with fee-burn sinks.  
- Oracle-grounded outputs (Chainlink, Pyth).
